The eval() expression is a very powerful built-in function of Python. It helps in evaluating an expression. The expression can be a Python statement, or a code object.

For example:

>>> eval("9 + 5")
14
>>> x = 2
>>> eval("x + 3")
5



# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT


var = input()

ans=eval(var)
ans
